                                &lt;p&gt;(This is a repost, from&amp;nbsp;august)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a local coffee company the other day and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/jlgosse&#34;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;
and I were talking about some annoyances when dealing with godaddys &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificates.
 Talking to him about this reminded me that I had this post in the pipe for a long
 time and gave me the motivation to finish&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Many browsers, if you set up a standard Godaddy &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; Certificate out of the box,
 you will get ssl errors in many browsers saying that they can&amp;#8217;t recognize your
 certificate authority, this is generally not a good thing the whole point of installing
 &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; is for security and establishing trust iwith your customers, clients and website&amp;nbsp;visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start the process of getting set up with an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificate from godaddy just go
 and purchase one. You can pick anyone you like, but in general for most things you
 can get away with just purchasing the cheapest one, I think its around&amp;nbsp;21$/yr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you purchase your certificate, open up a terminal and log onto your server.
 You first need to create a key and certificate request for your domain.
&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/524908.js?file=gistfile1.sh&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just fill out the requested information and you should be good to go. You then log
 into your godaddy account and provide godaddy with the certificate request and they
 will generate the certificate for you. With the cheaper certificate this process usually
 takes minutes. For the more expensive certificte the process takes considerably&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you recieve your certificates from godaddy, you need to put your certificates
 on your server and then you just add these lines to the approprate section of your
 configs depending on your&amp;nbsp;webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nginx:
&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/524908.js?file=gistfile2.sh&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For apache:
&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/524908.js?file=gistfile3.sh&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Awhile ago(I&amp;#8217;m not sure where), I ran across a list of programming/algorithm/computer
 science book reccomendations and on that list was &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/&#34;&gt;Structure and Interpretation
 of Computer Programs(&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then it and a few other books have been
 on the top of my &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; read&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in learning lisp for quite awhile, I think its probably the
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; influence, lisp is often talked
 about there as Hacker News is written in a dialect of lisp authored by
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~rtm/&#34;&gt;Robert Morris&lt;/a&gt;
 called &lt;a href=&#34;http://arclanguage.org&#34;&gt;Arc&lt;/a&gt;. So while in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt; the dialect of
 lisp is not Arc but Scheme, from its description and reviews I have read, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt; seems
 like it would be a great way to get started programming in&amp;nbsp;lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why learn lisp you say? Certianly not to actually program in it professionally, I
 actually don&amp;#8217;t know anyone who programs in lisp for their job(Thats not to say there
 aren&amp;#8217;t lisp jobs out there). The reason to learn lisp is that by all accounts learning
 lisp is a transformative experience. I have consistently read and have had one of my
 very good friends tell me that learning to write lisp changes the way you think about
 programming and writing software. If nothing else that should make it worth the
 time and effort to&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt;. I have been meaning to pick up a copy and start reading it for awhile
 but I had never got around to it. There is a web version but like a lot of people,
 I have a hard time reading from my computer screen, not because it hurts my eyes or
 anything like that, I think its just a matter of focus. There are so many things external
 to the book when you are reading it while sitting at your computer that it becomes tempting
 to multitask while reading. So today I was very excited to learn that &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ieure&#34;&gt;Ian Eure&lt;/a&gt;
 created an epub copy of the book and its available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/ieure/sicp&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect format for me, I can now load it onto my iphone(on stanza or ibooks)
 and read away while I spend my ~1.5 hours/day commuting on the bus back and forth to work.
 I usually try to get books in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; form and just read them out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5Nzg0MTU5&#34;&gt;dropbox&lt;/a&gt;,
 which is a good experience, but I would definately prefer epub as its easier to read.
 All in all this is a pretty big win for me and its certianly a great motivator to
 get me started reading &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt; and learning&amp;nbsp;Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any books like &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SICP&lt;/span&gt; that you would reccomend? I&amp;#8217;d love to get some suggestions,
 just leave a note in the&amp;nbsp;comments!&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Lately I have seen a bunch of posts where bloggers, developers, etc. talk about their
 current development environments and hardware. I really enjoy these posts because
 its always nice to see what tools other developers are using, so I thought I would
 chip in with a few blog posts of my own. In a couple of &amp;#8220;My Toolbox&amp;#8221; posts, I will
 talk about the hardware and software I use to do my work as Software Developer(currently
 doing mostly Python/Django work at &lt;a href=&#34;http://swixhq.com&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SWIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the hardware I use in the office is pretty basic. I currently use a
 &lt;strong&gt;13.3-Inch MacBook Pro&lt;/strong&gt;, a pretty standard &lt;strong&gt;Dell 22-inch monitor&lt;/strong&gt;,
 standard &lt;strong&gt;Apple keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; and the amazing &lt;strong&gt;Apple Magic Mouse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy going on there, pretty standard hardware configuration and generally
 what everyone in the office currently uses as we all tend to work both in the office
 and from home from time to time. This hardware is essentially the perfect setup for
 the work that I do. Generally the apps that I use are pretty light and I find the
 13.3 inch Macbook Pro to be pretty zippy. Probably the only thing that would be a
 good upgrade would be from the 22-24 inch monitor to maybe 2-22 inch&amp;nbsp;monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your setup look like? What kind of hardware do you&amp;nbsp;use?&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Its kind of interesting, Blackbird Pie just generates a html/css snippet that you
 can embed in your page. I am not sure if I prefer this way of doing things or the
 way &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; does it with cross site&amp;nbsp;javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;So as you can tell this all looks a bit different. This blog that you are currently
reading is &lt;strong&gt;completely static&lt;/strong&gt;. All of this post content is actually written in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; and then generated as static html by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hyde.github.com/&#34;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;. As you can tell some of the css is off and
this blog isn&amp;#8217;t overly full featured. I&amp;#8217;m considering this a work in process and
a little project to import my css skills as well as a fun little thing I can work
on, on the side.  I will probably write a post about how to get started with hyde
for people interested in trying it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that with this new blog its a completely fresh start, I haven&amp;#8217;t carried
over any of the old posts from my old blog and I could care less about the google
juice I am losing because of that. In this new incarnation of the blog, I&amp;#8217;m hoping
I will post a little more consistently as well as bring a tighter focus. I have
had &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikegrouchy.com&#34;&gt;mikegrouchy.com&lt;/a&gt; for 6 years and it has
been a blog that entire time, but there hasn&amp;#8217;t been a lot of great content. I plan
on bringing back some of my old tutorial posts that people used ,
but probably update them a bit which hopefully will be an&amp;nbsp;improvement.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
