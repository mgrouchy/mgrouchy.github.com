<div class="post-content">
	<p>One of the fundamental truths of software development is that you have to write code,
but one of the biggest fallacies is the idea that writing code is your job. When I
first started out as a software developer, I fell into that trap, writing code is
a powerful thing, its empowering, you feel like you are productive and you are
accomplishing things. However, what I have learned over the years is the real
truth of the matter. The truth that the job of a software developer is to write
as little code as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, we should not be getting ourselves into <a href="http://codegolf.com/">code golf</a>
situations where we are compacting code and saving keystrokes to the point where
the code you produce is no longer understandable. When you think about it though
the fact that most of your time will be maintaining the terrible code you wrote,
writing less code and not creating more work for yourself will start to look like
an exceptionally good&nbsp;idea.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Look around, look at your tools, look at the framework you likely use to
produce that thing you work on. Everything you do, all the tools you use,
everything is trying make you write less code. Your tools are trying to make
you less error prone, and abstracting away the things that will cause you trouble
down the&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>So why should you write less code? When I said earlier that your job was to write
less code, I was fibbing a little bit. Really your job is to <strong>think</strong>, your job
is to think about the problem at hand, devise an elegant solution and then turn
that solution into software. One of the byproducts of creating software is that you
have to write code to solve&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p><img alt="the thinker" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/The_Thinker,_Rodin.jpg/250px-The_Thinker,_Rodin.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Code is a&nbsp;by-product</h2>
<p>Code isn&#8217;t that important. We love to convince ourselves that it is because
as we actually start executing and turning our solutions into software, it seems
like writing code is both a means and an end unto itself. We talk about our
<a href="http://mikegrouchy.com/blog/compile-vim-with-python-on-osx-with-homebrew.html">editors</a>,
we talk about our <a href="http://pycoders.com">language of choice</a> and we talk about our
<a href="http://mikegrouchy.com/blog/zsh-is-your-friend.html">environments</a>. I do it,
you do it, we all do it. There is no shame in enjoying the craft of the work you do.
The trick is to stay focused. Code is awesome, but its also the enemy, it takes
time to write, it can be fragile, it can be unclear and not particularly&nbsp;robust.</p>
<p>This is why I stick with the mantra &#8220;Write less code&#8221;. Whenever I feel like something
is getting bigger than it should be or more complicated than it should be, I say
&#8220;Write less code&#8221;. Whenever I write so much code that it gets hard to keep it
in context, I refactor, I clean it up, all the while, thinking about &#8220;Write less&nbsp;code&#8221;.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say, sometimes there is no way to get around writing a
bunch of code, but if you can&#8217;t be concise, be clear. Writing less code is
writing <a href="http://amzn.to/MJFkE4">clean code</a>. Writing less code is also about
writing clear code. When you are economical with the code you write the purpose
of your code becomes&nbsp;clear.</p>
<p>So, whats the lesson here? Most importantly I think the lesson here is that
code is a by-product, its an unavoidable thing that you generate in the process
of doing your job. So think more, <a href="http://amzn.to/KHjbJp">refactor more</a>, remove some
old code and write less new code, do yourself a favor and start this&nbsp;today.</p>
